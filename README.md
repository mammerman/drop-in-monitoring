# Drop-in Monitoring Stack for Apprenda Cloud Platform
A drop-in monitoring stack with defaults for Apprenda Cloud Platform, built upon [Kismatic Enterprise Toolkit](https://github.com/apprenda/kismatic).

## Introduction
This project is a comprehensive monitoring solution that can be used to monitor any system (with additional configuration), but with defaults for the Apprenda Cloud Platform.  An Apprenda Cloud Platform operator should be able to provision the requisite VMs to stand up a cluster as described below and, using the [Kismatic Enterprise Toolkit](https://github.com/apprenda/kismatic), automatically create a monitoring stack that immediately reports information about a target Apprenda Cloud Platform environment.
